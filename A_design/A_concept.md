# Concept

Deep Echo is a device for messing with sounds and creating basic songs. Any sound can be sampled with the audio jack, then played using buttons on the device. There is no screen or menu, so every function is analog. This also makes the device easy for anyone to play with, no matter their age or experience.

There has not been innovation in hardware samplers.
