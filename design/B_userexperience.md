# User Experience
Haptics? Vegas lights? Color coding? Built in speaker? Multi-purpose LEDs?

Think very high level, what should the user feel like they are doing when using the device.

All functionality accessible with a single button press.

LEDs adjacent to the buttons indicate which functions are activated and provide immediate feedback when playing sounds.
