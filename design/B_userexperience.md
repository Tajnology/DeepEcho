# User Experience
Haptics? Vegas lights? Color coding? Built in speaker? Multi-purpose LEDs?

Think very high level, what should the user feel like they are doing when using the device?
 - Feel like they are shaping the sound - use sliders for parameters. Exclusive modes can be controlled with fixed position encoder (not able to source for hackathon), or multi-position switches.
 - Like their actions are happening quickly - avoid blocking wait to capture samples

All functionality accessible with a single button press.

LEDs adjacent to the buttons indicate which functions are activated and provide immediate feedback when playing sounds.
