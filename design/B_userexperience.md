User should:
- Feel like they are shaping the sound - use sliders for parameters. Exclusive modes can be controlled with fixed position encoder (not able to source for hackathon), or multi-position switches.
- Like their actions are happening quickly - avoid blocking wait to capture samples
- Be able to access all functionality accessible with a single button press.

Indicators when:
- A trigger is being played
- A menu option is activated
- A bank is selected
- Input is being received

Haptic feedback when:
- Fine tune reaches min, max or coarse point
